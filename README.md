# Overview of the Chat With Your Data (Using Azure AI Search) template

This app template showcases how to build one of the most powerful applications enabled by LLM - sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chat bots that can answer questions about specific source information right in the Microsoft Teams.
This app template also demonstrates usage of techniques like: 
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#what-is-rag), or RAG.
- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)
- [Teams AI Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams%20conversational%20ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview)

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20, 22
> - [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource and [Azure AI Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search).

> For local debugging using Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In file *env/.env.playground.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>`, deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>`, and embedding deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-embedding-deployment>`. And fill in your Azure AI search key `SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=<your-ai-search-key>` and endpoint `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=<your-ai-search-endpoint>`.
1. Do `npm install` and `npm run indexer:create -- <your-ai-search-key> <your-azure-openai-api-key>` to create the my documents index. Once you're done using the sample it's good practice to delete the index. You can do so with the `npm run indexer:delete -- <your-ai-search-key>` command.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground using a web browser. Select `Debug in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the agent.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Microsoft 365 Agents Playground:
