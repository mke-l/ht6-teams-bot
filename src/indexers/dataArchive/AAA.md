- · Store, distribution center and area/district office hourly team members are eligible for medical coverage when they work an average of 30 paid hours per week.*

If you enroll dependents, the Benefits Support Center will require you to verify your relationship. Required documentation may include a marriage license, affidavit of domestic partnership, income tax returns and birth certificates for your children.

Find more eligibility information in the Walgreens Health and Welfare Plan Summary Plan Description (SPD) posted on the Benefits Support Center website.

While on the site, you can check your 12-week and 52-week average hours. After you're eligible for coverage, click the Monitor Your Benefits Eligibility link to see your hours worked and the estimated number of hours you'll need to work during the current Measurement Period to meet the 30 average hours requirement.

- *   Your average hours are reviewed after 60 days of employment to determine eligibility. If your hours at that time average 30 hours or above, coverage is offered and effective on the first of the following month. Otherwise, your hours will be reviewed weekly based on actual hours worked during the most recent 12-week period. If your 12-week average rises to 30 hours or above, coverage is offered and effective on the first of the following month. In the enrollment materials mailed to your home address on file, see the Ongoing Eligibility Determination for Hourly Team Members insert for details.

## Medical coverage

Walgreens offers three medical plan options:

1

The BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access option makes it easier to access important care virtually from wherever you live. Lower your costs by using a Teladoc virtual PCP to coordinate your care and provide referrals when needed. You can also receive in-person care from in-network providers in BCBSIL's network, without a referral, at the Tier 2 benefits level.

2

3

Copay Plan options provide 100% coverage for certain routine services, like office visits, after you pay a copay ($20 per office visit or $35 per specialist office visit). There are two Copay options to choose from (Copay Plan or Premier Copay Plan) with different annual deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. Copay options have higher per-paycheck costs.

HSA Plan option features lower per-paycheck costs and offer the tax advantage of a Health Savings Account (HSA). There is a combined medical and prescription deductible, which means you'll pay the full cost for all nonpreventive services and prescriptions until the combined medical and prescription drug deductible is met.

Walgreens has selected a comprehensive and cost-effective medical insurance carrier for your area.

## Only in-network coverage

IMPORTANT: (except for emergencies)

Using in-network providers is critical . As a general rule, Walgreens medical plans do not cover out-of-network care except in emergencies.

## How the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access option works

If you enroll in the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access medical option, this is how you will receive care under the plan.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Choose your PCP

Select your virtual PCP on the Blue Element Mobile IL mobile app or on myBlueElementIL.com . You can change to a different Teladoc virtual PCP at any time. Plus, each family member who is age 18 or older can choose their own virtual PCP.

## Schedule your first appointment

When you need care, use the Blue Element Mobile IL app to schedule a virtual visit using the Primary 360 tile-choose who needs care, which provider you'd like to see, if you'd like to meet via phone or video, and then select a day and time that works for you. You will also complete an assessment in the app before your visit to provide your PCP with information.

## Prepare for your appointment

You will receive a blood pressure and heart monitor in the mail ahead of your first visit, and you will complete an easy health assessment.

## Meet with your PCP

Meet virtually with your Teladoc virtual PCP to discuss the information you submitted and any other health concerns you have.

- · For care you can't receive virtually, you can choose to receive Tier 1 benefits and lower your costs by using in-network in-person providers referred by your Teladoc virtual PCP (including certain Walgreens Health partners and other BCBSIL Network providers).
- · You also have the option to receive in-person care from any in-network provider in BCBSIL's network, without a referral, at the Tier 2 benefits level.

## Receive your care plan

After your visit, your Teladoc virtual PCP will add your care plan, including any prescriptions, to your member portal. You can have your prescriptions filled at the pharmacy of your choice, subject to the terms of your health plan's prescription benefit and will pay the lesser of the applicable copay or the cost of the drug.

<!-- image -->

## How the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access option works continued

If you enroll in BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access, you will select a Teladoc virtual PCP to be your first point of contact. But you are not restricted to receiving 'virtual-only' or 'telehealth-only' care. In-person visits to network providers are permitted, and Tier 1 benefits will apply when you are referred by your Teladoc virtual PCP to Walgreens Health partners or a BCBSIL Network provider (otherwise, Tier 2 benefits will apply). Children under age 18 must seek care from participating in-person providers, so their care will be considered Tier 1 whether or not any virtual care is used.

## How you pay for care under this option

All virtual care services through Teladoc are $0, including PCP, specialist, mental health visits, chronic condition management and more. Other common in-person services are available for a flat copay including specialist and mental health visits (under the Tier 2 benefit), labs, basic radiology and urgent care. The amount of your copay will depend on whether you receive a referral from your virtual PCP into Tier 1 or you seek in-person care without a referral under Tier 2.

In both Tier 1 and Tier 2, your nonpreventive care is subject to a deductible, coinsurance and an out-of-pocket maximum-but many common healthcare services are available with just a copay.

Preventive care is always covered at 100% in both Tier 1 and Tier 2. Children under age 18 must seek care from participating in-person providers, so their care will be considered Tier 1 whether or not virtual care is used.

## Have questions?

You can call the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access plan's customer service number at 1.855.453.4747 . Representatives are available Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central time.

- *   Many services have copays instead of coinsurance and a deductible. Copays count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. Because the annual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum cross apply between two tiers, the Tier 2 amount is the most you will pay.

Note: With the HSA plan, you'll pay the full cost for all nonpreventive services and prescriptions until the combined medical and prescription drug deductible is met before your plan starts paying benefits.

The above benefit(s) may not apply (or may apply differently) to certain union and other team members based on applicable agreements.

If you take specialty medications, you can have up to a 30-day supply of medications filled through Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy or through a Walgreens retail pharmacy. The program provides educational support, side-effect management, and access to on-staff pharmacists and nurses.

## Consider all your options

Before you choose a medical plan, it's critical that you do your research:

- · Ensure your home address is up to date. Find the link on W Connect or on StoreNet &gt; Tools &gt; Applications &gt; People Central.
- · Verify that your providers participate in the network for each option by using the Provider Search tool when you enroll for coverage on the Benefits Support Center.
- · Confirm the network hospitals and facilities in your area.
- · Keep in mind: If you are enrolling in a UHC network that requires you to designate a primary care physician (PCP) for yourself and your covered family members, you'll be prompted to do so when you enroll. If you need to change your PCP after you enroll, you'll need to contact UHC directly. In UHC markets where there is tiering, Tier 2 providers will cost you more.

<!-- image -->

## How the annual deductible works

Each family member enrolled in one of the Copay medical options has an individual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.

Under the HSA Plan, your family's combined healthcare costs are used to meet one deductible and one out-of-pocket maximum. For example, if you have family coverage under the HSA Plan option and you incur $2,000 in eligible expenses, the plan would not pay benefits until the entire $4,000 family deductible has been met.

In the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access Plan, your individual (or your family's combined) medical costs are used to meet either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 plan deductible. However, many common services (e.g., PCP visits, mental health counseling and specialist visits, among others) are at no or low cost and not subject to the deductible.

TIP 7 If you choose the HSA Plan option, you're eligible to contribute to a Health Savings Account. See the Spending and savings accounts section for details.

## Medical carriers

Walgreens continually reviews medical coverage offerings to make sure all team members have access to a medical insurance carrier and provider networks that provide the best value and quality of care. There are a few markets where Walgreens offers a choice of carriers. The BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access Plan is available in all markets. You'll see the designated carriers for your area when you enroll.

## ID cards

In general, most Walgreens medical plan participants will receive one ID card for both medical and prescription drug coverage. If you enroll in the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access option, you will receive an ID card from Teladoc. Also, UHC may issue new ID cards for team members in the NexusACO ®  network in certain markets.

<!-- image -->

## Carrier networks

Your medical carrier is one part of the equation. The other part is the type of network that's offered by the carrier.

- · All team members have access to a Broad Network that offers more provider choice but may have higher per-paycheck costs.
- · Lower-cost Value Networks (with a smaller number of providers) are available in many areas too.

Each Broad and Value Network has its own providers, even if they are offered through the same medical carrier.

In the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access medical option, you receive care virtually first. Your Teladoc PCP will refer you to a Walgreens Health partner (or a BCBSIL Network provider when needed) to help you receive Tier 1 benefits. You can also seek care from providers in the BCBSIL Network without a referral at a higher out-of-pocket cost under Tier 2 benefits.

## If your carrier is Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois (BCBSIL)

Whether you choose a Broad Network or a Value Network, you'll get the most value when you visit network providers with the BCBSIL Blue Distinction® designation. In the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access option, your Teladoc PCP will refer you to in-person providers in the BCBSIL Network or VillageMD-part of Walgreens U.S. Healthcare segment-to help ensure you receive Tier 1 benefits.

You can also tap into BCBSIL Blue Distinction Centers of Excellence (COEs) (BDC and BDC+) if you need more complex care. These COEs are required for cardiac and transplant procedures through BCBSIL.

## Carrier networks continued

## If your carrier is UnitedHealthcare (UHC)

Two of UnitedHealthcare's Value Networks-the NexusACO ®  and Navigate networks-require you to select and get referrals for most services from a primary care physician (PCP).

The NexusACO® network also features provider tiering. If you don't use top-rated or specialty Tier 1 providers, you'll pay more for your coverage (40% or 50% after the deductible plus copays for some services, instead of 20%).

UnitedHealthcare also offers Centers of Excellence (COEs) for specific conditions. You are required to use their COEs for cancer, transplant, fertility and congenital heart disease procedures.

## If your carrier is Kaiser Permanente or Dean / Prevea360

Visit the carrier's website for details about the provider network and any special requirements.

## Did you know?

$ 5 per clinic

Most Walgreens medical plans include a $5 copay for Walgreens in-store clinic visits. If you have an HSA and haven't yet met the annual deductible for your plan, you may be charged the full cost at time of service. Depending on the clinic, you may be charged the $5 copay and then billed later for the remaining cost. visit

## Centers of Excellence (COEs)

Both BCBSIL and UHC require you to use their COEs for specific procedures, which are noted on the previous page. Walgreens also offers a separate Carrum Health Medical and Surgery Benefit that offers access to Centers of Excellence for other types of procedures.

## Tobacco user status

The online enrollment system defaults you to a tobacco user status of 'YES.' This default affects what you'll pay for medical, voluntary life insurance and critical illness coverage (if applicable). If you and/ or your spouse/domestic partner aren't tobacco users (see definition to the right), you'll need to change your tobacco user status to 'NO' for yourself and your spouse/domestic partner when you first enroll. Team members with a 'YES' status will pay up to $1,500 more for medical coverage:

- • $750 per year for a team member who uses tobacco, PLUS
- • $750 per year for a spouse/domestic partner who uses tobacco.

You'll also pay higher tobacco user rates for your voluntary life insurance and critical illness coverage.

If you and your spouse/domestic partner are tobacco users, you can have the medical plan surcharge removed by completing the free 365 Get Healthy Here Tobacco-Free Program. Visit the Benefits Support Center to learn more.

## Definition of tobacco user

Have you and/or your spouse/domestic partner (if applicable) used tobacco/nicotine products (cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff or electronic nicotine delivery systems such as e-cigarettes, vaping devices, vape pens) within the last three months (regardless of frequency)?

If yes, you (and/or your spouse/domestic partner) are considered tobacco users, no matter how often you've used these products. Your tobacco user status should remain 'YES' for the medical plan and any voluntary life insurance or critical illness coverage you elect. Be sure to read and answer the tobacco user status questions carefully.

Note: For critical illness coverage, you (and/or your spouse/domestic partner, if applicable) are considered a tobacco user if you've used any of the products listed above within the past 12 months. For purposes of this coverage only, e-cigarette and marijuana users are considered non-tobacco users. The use of marijuana must be legal in the participant's state of residence and prescribed by a physician, or there is the possibility of a covered condition caused or contributed to by the use of marijuana may not be paid, due to the voluntary drug use exclusion.

## Get help when you need it through your medical carrier's Care Coordination program

If you choose a Copay or HSA medical plan option through BCBSIL or UHC, your carrier's Care Coordination program offers help through a:

## Note to enrollees in UHC options

- • BCBSIL Health Advocate; or
- • UHC Care Coordinator.

These Care Coordinators/Health Advocates are your trusted advisors who can help you find lower-cost, high-quality network care and help you make the best choices when seeking care-from helping you find a new doctor to getting a second opinion on surgery. Providers can typically perform a procedure at different facilities that all have a different negotiated facility rate-so it's definitely worthwhile to research all available options.

If you enroll in a UHC option that requires you to coordinate care through your PCP, the PCP will be your first point of contact. You can also work with Care Coordinators if eligible, but if your plan requires it, always start with your PCP.

## Note to enrollees in the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access Plan option

Your Care Coordinators/Health Advocates can help weigh the pros and cons of treatment options-whether for complex care, the emergency room, urgent care, doctor's office or telemedicine. They can also help you manage a health condition or prepare for surgery by connecting you to resources and support available at no additional cost as part of your benefits. Call the number on the back of your medical ID card to connect to a Care Coordinator/Health Advocate.

If you are enrolled in the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access Plan option, you will coordinate your care through your Teladoc virtual PCP.

## Easy access to your Care Coordinator/Health Advocate

- · Other orthopedic procedures (e.g., hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, foot)
- • Cardiac (heart) surgery
- • Breast and thyroid cancer
- · Remote diagnosis, treatment planning and care guidance for all forms of cancer

This benefit gives you access to the providers who are ranked in the top 10% nationally. Walgreens covers all or most of the procedure and travel costs (including costs for a travel companion over age 18), so you won't worry about traditional health insurance or surprise bills.

Plus, it provides 100% coverage for eligible expenses-including travel for yourself and your designated travel partner (must be over age 18). Note: The 100% coverage applies after the deductible if you enroll in the HSA Plan option.

If your carrier has a COE in place for a procedure not covered by the Carrum Health Medical and Surgery Benefit, you must use that COE. For example, UHC requires COEs for cancer, transplant and fertility procedures, as well as congenital heart disease.

Carrum Health also includes access to Carrum's Guidance Program for cancer diagnoses. This program gives you access to:

- · A virtual expert second opinion and personalized treatment plan development
- • An oncology-specialized nurse at a Carrum Center of Excellence
- · A dedicated Carrum care team specialist, who will help coordinate your care

Visit Carrum.me/Walgreens or call 1.888.855.7806 for support. You'll also find more information and details in the Carrum SPD Insert posted on the Resource Library page of the Benefits Support Center.

Note: The Carrum Health Medical and Surgery Benefit is a special benefit for employees, dependents and COBRA participants enrolled in any of the UHC or BCBSIL medical plans, including BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access. Your deductible, copay and coinsurance are fully waived except if you're enrolled in the HSA Plan option. Per IRS regulations, HSA enrollees must pay the federal minimum deductible before additional costs are waived. Travel coverage varies based on the procedure. Per IRS rules, a portion of the covered travel expenses will be reported as taxable income.

## Telehealth

For minor health conditions or referrals, team members have access to care from licensed providers through the telehealth vendor associated with their medical carrier (BCBSIL or UHC). Your cost for telehealth services will vary as shown in the table.

Note: This section covers telehealth services provided to enrollees in the Copay or HSA Plan.

To start a telehealth session on your mobile device, computer or phone, visit your carrier's website (see table), register for an account and follow the prompts.

## If you have:

- · Chosen BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access as your medical option: Start by contacting your Teladoc PCP.
- · Chosen an HSA Plan or Copay Plan option with BCBSIL or UHC as your medical carrier: Download the '98point6' app to your device from the Apple Store or Google Play.

## Important:

- · Telehealth services aren't available in all states. Contact your medical carrier to learn about any applicable restrictions.
- · In the rare case that your condition is not suitable for a telehealth visit, you will be referred to a provider to make an in-office appointment. Please confirm with your Care Coordinator or Teladoc PCP that the provider's services will be covered in-network by your medical plan.
- · Some telehealth vendors offer options for behavioral health services. Contact your medical carrier or your telehealth vendor for more information.*
- *   Receive up to five FREE mental health counseling visits through Life365, and up to five additional FREE visits for every new issue. To learn more, call Life365 24/7 at 1.855.777.0078 or visit online at walgreenslife365.com , GROUP CODE: life365.

## How does a telehealth visit differ from a virtual visit with a network provider or doctor?

Your network provider or doctor you see regularly may offer 'virtual visits' over the phone, online or through video chat, instead of an in-office visit. These virtual visits will be covered under the regular plan benefit.

Your telehealth vendor provides care virtually too, but separately from your network provider or doctor you see regularly. See the table for cost and contact information.

MetLife is the marketing name used by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MLIC) and its affiliates.

The supplemental coverage through MetLife is being communicated to you for informational purposes only. The benefit is not sponsored by Walgreens, is not intended to be covered by ERISA, and its inclusion in the materials should not be construed as an endorsement of the product.

The coverage is provided under forms GVCIP4, GVSP2 and GVAP6, or state variations thereof. The coverage has exclusions and limitations. Contact your benefits representative for full details.

The above benefit(s) may not apply (or may apply differently) to certain union and other team members based on applicable agreements.

## Spending and savings accounts

## Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)

## Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs)

To give you more flexibility to save for short- and long-term medical costs, you have access to a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) option that is compatible with a Health Savings Account (HSA). HSAs have many tax advantages that can help you get more for your healthcare dollars now and in the future.

## HSAs provide a triple tax advantage

- • Contributions are tax-free;
- • Contributions can be invested and enjoy tax-free growth; and
- • Withdrawals used for qualified expenses are tax-free.

TIP 7 See the Medical coverage section and the Summaries of Benefits and Coverage (SBCs) on the Benefits Support Center website for details on what you pay before and after you meet the annual deductible.

## Important!

With an HSA Plan, you'll pay the full cost for all nonpreventive services and prescriptions until you meet the individual or full family deductible (for two or more covered dependents). This includes costs for prescription drugs, doctor's office visits, telehealth consultations and visits to Walgreens in-store clinics.

If you have funds in your HSA, you can use your HSA debit card to pay these out-of-pocket costs. You can also pay for the services yourself and request a reimbursement-now or in the future.

## Questions about the HSA?

Contact Optum Bank at www.OptumBank.com or 1.866.234.8913 . You can also download the Optum Bank mobile app for account management.

Looking to cut costs on healthcare or dependent care? Flexible Spending Accounts help you save by using pre-tax dollars for eligible expenses. That means you don't pay taxes on the money you contribute or use for these costs. What a great way to get more for your money!

## For HSA plan participants who elect the Healthcare FSA

If you enroll in the HSA Plan and the Healthcare FSA, your Healthcare FSA will automatically become a Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA until you meet your medical plan deductible. A Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA can only be used for eligible dental and vision expenses. Limited Purpose debit card transactions for medical or prescription drug expenses will be declined, and you will not be reimbursed for those expenses.

After you meet your medical deductible, contact Optum to update your account to a post-deductible Healthcare FSA. Then, you can use the account for medical and prescription drug expenses moving forward.

## Questions about the FSAs?

Contact Optum at www.OptumBank.com or 1.800.243.5543. You can also download the Optum mobile app for account management.

| Other details | • Must enroll in the HSA plan. • You can change your HSA election throughout the year. • Funding your HSA with automatic payroll deductions lowers your taxable income. • As your HSA balance grows, any interest you earn is also tax-free. • You'll receive an HSA debit card from Optum Bank that makes it easy to access your account. • You can only use funds from your HSA after they've been deposited into your account. • To be eligible for the HSA, you can't be covered by Medicaid, Medicare or another non-HDHP medical plan. • While domestic partners are eligible for coverage under an HSA option, HSA reimbursementsfortheir out-of-pocket medical costs aren't considered eligible medical expenses (per the IRS) and will be taxed. | • The total amount you choose to contribute for the year is taken out of your paycheck over time, but you get the full amount for use as soon as your coverage takes effect. • You can't change your Healthcare FSA election mid-year unless you experience a qualifying life event. | • The total amount you choose to contribute for the year is taken out of your paycheck over time; you can only request reimbursements for up to the amount you've already contributed for the year . • It's a good idea to speak with a tax professional to determine if the Dependent Care FSA or the federal tax credit provides you with the greatest savings. |

The above benefit(s) may not apply (or may apply differently) to certain union and other team members based on applicable agreements.

## Commuter Benefit Plan

The Commuter Benefit Plan lets you set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay the cost of parking and/or using public transportation or vanpool to and from work. By using pre-tax funds, you can lower your taxable income and save on your daily commute! This is a month-to-month benefit that you can enroll in at any time.

Here's an example of how the plan works: You must enroll from the 4th of one month to the 3rd of the next month, for the following benefit month. For example, for the March 2025 benefit month, you may enroll from January 4 to February 3, 2025.

Walgreens provides life insurance and disability protection to eligible full-time team members. Any company-paid coverage from Walgreens is automatic. You don't need to enroll to be covered. However, you do need to enroll to receive voluntary coverage.

Remember to record your beneficiaries on the Benefits Support Center website. Your beneficiaries are the people who receive your life insurance benefit in the event of your death. It's very important to get this information into the system and keep it up to date over time.

## Life and AD&amp;D insurance

MetLife is the carrier for your Company-Paid and Voluntary Life and Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) coverage. If you are eligible, you automatically receive company-paid coverage and you have the option to enroll in additional voluntary coverage. You pay the cost of this coverage through convenient payroll deductions, as you do for your other healthcare coverage.

## Eligibility

## Company-Paid Life

You're eligible for both the company-paid and voluntary life and AD&amp;D insurance if you are a:

- · Full-time salaried team member, actively working at least 30 hours per week for 30 days
- · Full-time hourly team member, actively working at least 30 hours per week for at least 90 days

## Reminder!

Confirm your beneficiary(ies) on the Benefits Support Center website. You'll need to provide your beneficiary's name, address, Social Security number and birthdate.

<!-- image -->

If you meet the Plan's eligibility requirements, you are automatically enrolled in coverage for a life insurance benefit equal to:

- · 1.5 times annual base salary for all salaried team members and any eligible hourly team members
- · $25,000 for all other hourly team members

Note: If your employment is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, you may be eligible for a different company-paid Life or Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) benefit. Visit the Benefits Support Center to confirm your coverage amounts.

If you're a salaried team member and your life insurance coverage is over $50,000, you'll pay income tax on the amount over $50,000 (due to IRS regulations).

The above benefit(s) may not apply (or may apply differently) to certain union and other team members based on applicable agreements.

## Life and AD&amp;D insurance

continued

## Voluntary Life and AD&amp;D Insurance

Benefits-eligible hourly and salaried team members also have the opportunity to buy up to a higher level of coverage through voluntary life insurance.

## You

- · Elect up to 10 times annual base salary in increments of $10,000 up to $500,000 Guaranteed Issue without Evidence of Insurability (EOI).
- · The total of your company-paid and voluntary coverage combined can't exceed $12 million.

## Spouse/Domestic Partner

- · Elect up to $750,000 in coverage or the dollar amount of your combined company-paid and voluntary coverage-whichever is less-in increments of $1,000 up to $40,000 Guaranteed Issue without Evidence of Insurability (EOI).

## Dependent Children

- · You can elect up to $25,000 in coverage in $5,000 increments. Evidence of Insurability is not required.

You can enroll in voluntary life insurance coverage, for you and your family, at any time during the year. You can enroll in voluntary life insurance via the Benefits Support Center. However, Evidence of Insurability (EOI) rules will apply for any elections or increases at any time other than when you are first eligible.

Note: Coverage rates are based on whether you and/or your covered spouse/ domestic partner (if applicable) use tobacco products. When you enroll, you'll need to certify your tobacco user status to receive non-tobacco user rates. If you and your spouse/domestic partner have used tobacco/nicotine products (cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff or electronic delivery systems such as e-cigarettes, vaping devices or vape pens) within the last three months, you're considered a tobacco user, regardless of how often you've used these products.

## Whole Life Insurance + Long-Term Care (LTC) Plan*

Walgreens offers a new type of financial protection benefit: A Whole Life Insurance benefit that includes a Long-Term Care (LTC) rider. The policy includes three parts-Whole Life Insurance, a Long-Term Care rider and it builds cash you can draw from if needed.

Whole Life insurance provides lifelong coverage and a cash value component, while the LTC rider adds protection against the potentially high costs of long-term care. You and your spouse/ domestic partner can choose whether to enroll based on your needs.

This voluntary benefit allows you to gain confidence in knowing that you have a plan in place to address your future life insurance needs and potential long-term care expenses. If needed, either the Life or the Long-Term Care benefit can be utilized without depleting the value of the other benefit.

You have a special opportunity to elect this coverage with a guaranteed rate lock for the life of your coverage. The younger you are when you enroll, the lower your rates will be for the life of your coverage! You can only enroll when you are newly eligible or during Open Enrollment each year. You cannot increase your coverage during the year, but you can drop coverage. You may also choose coverage for your spouse or domestic partner if you enroll in coverage for yourself. If you get married during the year, which is a qualifying life event, you may elect coverage for your new spouse, but only if you are currently enrolled in team member only coverage.

- *   Accelerated death benefit with restoration and extension of benefits. This is a voluntary benefit, and you can choose whether to enroll based on your needs.

The Whole Life Insurance + LTC through Allstate is being communicated to you for informational purposes only. The benefit is not sponsored by Walgreens, is not intended to be covered by ERISA and its inclusion in the materials should not be construed as an endorsement of the product.

The above benefit(s) may not apply (or may apply differently) to certain union and other team members based on applicable agreements.

If eligible, your company-paid coverage from Walgreens is automatic. You don't need to enroll to be covered. However, you do need to enroll to be covered for the voluntary disability plan.

You are generally eligible for company matching contributions after one year plus 1,000 hours of service.
