  "title": "How you pay for care under this option",
  "content": "All virtual care services through Teladoc are $0, including PCP, specialist, mental health visits, chronic condition management and more. Other common in-person services are available for a flat copay including specialist and mental health visits (under the Tier 2 benefit), labs, basic radiology and urgent care. The amount of your copay will depend on whether you receive a referral from your virtual PCP into Tier 1 or you seek in-person care without a referral under Tier 2.\nIn both Tier 1 and Tier 2, your nonpreventive care is subject to a deductible, coinsurance and an out-of-pocket maximum-but many common healthcare services are available with just a copay.\nPreventive care is always covered at 100% in both Tier 1 and Tier 2. Children under age 18 must seek care from participating in-person providers, so their care will be considered Tier 1 whether or not virtual care is used.",
