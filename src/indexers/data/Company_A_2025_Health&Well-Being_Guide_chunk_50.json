  "content": "The online enrollment system defaults you to a tobacco user status of \"YES.\" This default affects what you'll pay for medical, voluntary life insurance and critical illness coverage (if applicable). If you and/ or your spouse/domestic partner aren't tobacco users (see definition to the right), you'll need to change your tobacco user status to \"NO\" for yourself and your spouse/domestic partner when you first enroll. Team members with a \"YES\" status will pay up to $1,500 more for medical coverage:\n· $750 per year for a team member who uses tobacco, PLUS\n· $750 per year for a spouse/domestic partner who uses tobacco.\nYou'll also pay higher tobacco user rates for your voluntary life insurance and critical illness coverage.\nIf you and your spouse/domestic partner are tobacco users, you can have the medical plan surcharge removed by completing the free 365 Get Healthy Here Tobacco-Free Program.
