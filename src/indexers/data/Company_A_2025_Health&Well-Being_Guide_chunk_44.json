  "content": "Your medical carrier is one part of the equation. The other part is the type of network that's offered by the carrier.\n. All team members have access to a Broad Network that offers more provider choice but may have higher per-paycheck costs.\n. Lower-cost Value Networks (with a smaller number of providers) are available in many areas too.\nEach Broad and Value Network has its own providers, even if they are offered through the same medical carrier.\nIn the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access medical option, you receive care virtually first. Your Teladoc PCP will refer you to a Company A Health partner (or a BCBSIL Network provider when needed) to help you receive Tier 1 benefits. You can also seek care from providers in the BCBSIL Network without a referral at a higher out-of-pocket cost under Tier 2 benefits.",
