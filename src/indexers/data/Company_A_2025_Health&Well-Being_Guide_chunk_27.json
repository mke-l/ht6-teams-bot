  "content": "If you enroll in BCBSIL my VirtualCare Access, you will select a Teladoc virtual PCP to be your first point of contact. But you are not restricted to receiving \"virtual-only\" or \"telehealth-only\" care. In-person visits to network providers are permitted, and Tier 1 benefits will apply when you are referred by your Teladoc virtual PCP to Company A Health partners or a BCBSIL Network provider (otherwise, Tier 2 benefits will apply). Children under age 18 must seek care from participating in-person providers, so their care will be considered Tier 1 whether or not any virtual care is used.",
