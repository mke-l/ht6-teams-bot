  "content": "Two of UnitedHealthcare's Value Networks-the NexusACO® and Navigate networks-require you to select and get referrals for most services from a primary care physician (PCP).\nThe NexusACO® network also features provider tiering. If you don't use top-rated or specialty Tier 1 providers, you'll pay more for your coverage (40% or 50% after the deductible plus copays for some services, instead of 20%).\nUnitedHealthcare also offers Centers of Excellence (COEs) for specific conditions. You are required to use their COEs for cancer, transplant, fertility and congenital heart disease procedures.",
