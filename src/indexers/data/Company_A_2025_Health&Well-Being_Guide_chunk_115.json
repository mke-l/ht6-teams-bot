  "content": "EarnIn is a financial service designed to provide early access to your earned wages, helping you manage unexpected expenses with greater flexibility. Company A team members get a $0.50 discount on all optional Lightning Speed transfers. While EarnIn offers the option to provide a tip to support their service, tipping is not required. Visit www.earnin.com for more details.\nAs part of our review of terms and prevalence of the various third-party advance pay services in the marketplace, Company A has decided to partner with EarnIn to communicate and describe the EarnIn offerings to our team members, including early pay access and other services. Company A has no financial, administrative or other involvement in these services, which are exclusively between EarnIn and each team member, and are no different than the services offered by EarnIn to the general public. Company A is not providing any team member data to EarnIn and assumes no responsibility or liability with respect to EarnIn services. The decision of whether to utilize the services of EarnIn (and/or any other early pay access provider) is strictly yours.\nPAGE LAST VIEWED\nW\nENROLLMENT CENTRAL HEALTH & INSURANCE\nLIFE & DISABILITY\nWELL-BEING\nFINANCIAL WELL-BEING\nAND MORE\nCONTACTS\nBENEFITS AT A GLANCE 45",
