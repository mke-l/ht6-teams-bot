You can enroll in this plan at any time after you are eligible.\nAs a Company A team member, you can join the plan if you're 18 years of age or older. You can participate immediately upon hire, with no waiting period. Once you join, you can contribute up to 90% of your pay, up to the annual IRS limit. You choose how to invest your plan account, using any combination of the plan's investment funds.\nYou are generally eligible for company matching contributions after one year plus 1,000 hours of service.
