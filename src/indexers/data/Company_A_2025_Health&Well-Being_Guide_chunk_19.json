Lower your costs by using a Teladoc virtual PCP to coordinate your care and provide referrals when needed. You can also receive in-person care from in-network providers in BCBSIL's network, without a referral, at the Tier 2 benefits level.\n2 Copay Plan options provide 100% coverage for certain routine services, like office visits, after you pay a copay ($20 per office visit or $35 per specialist office visit). There are two Copay options to choose from (Copay Plan or Premier Copay Plan) with different annual deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. Copay options have higher per-paycheck costs.\n3 HSA Plan option features lower per-paycheck costs and offer the tax advantage of a Health Savings Account (HSA). There is a combined medical and prescription deductible, which means you'll pay the full cost for all nonpreventive services and prescriptions until the combined medical and prescription drug deductible is met.\nCompany A has selected a comprehensive and cost-effective medical insurance carrier for your area.\nIMPORTANT: Only in-network coverage (except for emergencies) Using in-network providers is critical.
