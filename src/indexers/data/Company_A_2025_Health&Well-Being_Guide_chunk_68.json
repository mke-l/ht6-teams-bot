  "content": "With an HSA Plan, you'll pay the full cost for all nonpreventive services and prescriptions until you meet the individual or full family deductible (for two or more covered dependents). This includes costs for prescription drugs, doctor's office visits, telehealth consultations and visits to Company A in-store clinics.\nIf you have funds in your HSA, you can use your HSA debit card to pay these out-of-pocket costs. You can also pay for the services yourself and request a reimbursement-now or in the future.",
