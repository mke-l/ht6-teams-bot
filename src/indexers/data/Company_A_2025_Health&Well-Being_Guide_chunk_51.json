  "title": "Definition of tobacco user",
  "content": "Have you and/or your spouse/domestic partner (if applicable) used tobacco/nicotine products (cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff or electronic nicotine delivery systems such as e-cigarettes, vaping devices, vape pens) within the last three months (regardless of frequency)?\nIf yes, you (and/or your spouse/domestic partner) are considered tobacco users, no matter how often you've used these products. Your tobacco user status should remain \"YES\" for the medical plan and any voluntary life insurance or critical illness coverage you elect. Be sure to read and answer the tobacco user status questions carefully.\nNote: For critical illness coverage, you (and/or your spouse/domestic partner, if applicable) are considered a tobacco user if you've used any of the products listed above within the past 12 months. For purposes of this coverage only, e-cigarette and marijuana users are considered non-tobacco users. The use of marijuana must be legal in the participant's state of residence and prescribed by a physician, or there is the possibility of a covered condition caused or contributed to by the use of marijuana may not be paid, due to the voluntary drug use exclusion.",
