Evidence of Insurability is not required.\nYou can enroll in voluntary life insurance coverage, for you and your family, at any time during the year. You can enroll in voluntary life insurance via the Benefits Support Center. However, Evidence of Insurability (EOI) rules will apply for any elections or increases at any time other than when you are first eligible.\nNote: Coverage rates are based on whether you and/or your covered spouse/ domestic partner (if applicable) use tobacco products. When you enroll, you'll need to certify your tobacco user status to receive non-tobacco user rates. If you and your spouse/domestic partner have used tobacco/nicotine products (cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, snuff or electronic delivery systems such as e-cigarettes, vaping devices or vape pens) within the last three months, you're considered a tobacco user, regardless of how often you've used these products.",
