  "content": "If you choose a Copay or HSA medical plan option through BCBSIL or UHC, your carrier's Care Coordination program offers help through a:\n· BCBSIL Health Advocate; or\n· UHC Care Coordinator.\nThese Care Coordinators/Health Advocates are your trusted advisors who can help you find lower-cost, high-quality network care and help you make the best choices when seeking care-from helping you find a new doctor to getting a second opinion on surgery. Providers can typically perform a procedure at different facilities that all have a different negotiated facility rate-so it's definitely worthwhile to research all available options.\nYour Care Coordinators/Health Advocates can help weigh the pros and cons of treatment options-whether for complex care, the emergency room, urgent care, doctor's office or telemedicine. They can also help you manage a health condition or prepare for surgery by connecting you to resources and support available at no additional cost as part of your benefits. Call the number on the back of your medical ID card to connect to a Care Coordinator/Health Advocate.",
