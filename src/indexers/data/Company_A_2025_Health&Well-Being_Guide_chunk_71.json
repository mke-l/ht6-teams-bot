  "content": "If you enroll in the HSA Plan and the Healthcare FSA, your Healthcare FSA will automatically become a Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA until you meet your medical plan deductible. A Limited Purpose Healthcare FSA can only be used for eligible dental and vision expenses. Limited Purpose debit card transactions for medical or prescription drug expenses will be declined, and you will not be reimbursed for those expenses.\nAfter you meet your medical deductible, contact Optum to update your account to a post-deductible Healthcare FSA. Then, you can use the account for medical and prescription drug expenses moving forward.",
