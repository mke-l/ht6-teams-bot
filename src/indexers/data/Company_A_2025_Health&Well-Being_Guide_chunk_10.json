  "content": "You must enroll within 31 days of being eligible. Otherwise, you will not have medical coverage or coverage for most other benefits.\nYou won't be able to add or change coverage until the Open Enrollment for the next calendar year. There are some exceptions to this \"no mid-year changes\" rule if you have a qualifying life event, like marriage, divorce, birth or adoption. You must report your qualifying life event either online through the Benefits Support Center website or by calling the Benefits Support Center within 31 days of the event.\nYou'll find more information in the Company A Health and Welfare Plan Summary Plan Description (SPD) that's posted in the Resource Library on the Benefits Support Center.",
