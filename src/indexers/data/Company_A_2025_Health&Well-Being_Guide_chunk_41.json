  "title": "How the annual deductible works",
  "content": "Each family member enrolled in one of the Copay medical options has an individual deductible and out-of-pocket maximum.\nUnder the HSA Plan, your family's combined healthcare costs are used to meet one deductible and one out-of-pocket maximum. For example, if you have family coverage under the HSA Plan option and you incur $2,000 in eligible expenses, the plan would not pay benefits until the entire $4,000 family deductible has been met.\nIn the BCBSIL myVirtualCare Access Plan, your individual (or your family's combined) medical costs are used to meet either a Tier 1 or Tier 2 plan deductible. However, many common services (e.g., PCP visits, mental health counseling and specialist visits, among others) are at no or low cost and not subject to the deductible.\nTIP > If you choose the HSA Plan option, you're eligible to contribute to a Health Savings Account. See the Spending and savings accounts section for details.",
